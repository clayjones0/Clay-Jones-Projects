My Background:

Greetings, My name is Clay Marcellus Jones. I am currently a senior at Norfolk State University. I major in Computer Science Cybersecurity and my expected gradation date is May 2025. Throughout this time, I've had two paid internships, participated in a paid summer research program, passed the CompTIA Security Plus exam, and competed in various CTFs. With this experience, I believe I can provide skills in programming, basic knowledge using reconnaissance tools, knowledge of security fundamentals/basics, technical writing, bright ideas, and a willingness to learn.  My relevant class work includes, Network Administration, Software Engineering, Data Communication, and many others. My goal as of right now is to get more certifications such as the CompTIA Network Plus, gain a security clearance, and find an entry level position in the cyber field, specifically in SOC and Analytics. My overall career goal is to become a Penetration Tester or a tier three SOC analyst.
